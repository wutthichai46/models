# ResNet50 v1.5 training

<!-- 10. Description -->

This document has instructions for running ResNet50 v1.5 training
using Intel-optimized TensorFlow.


<!--- 30. Datasets -->
## Datasets

Note that the ImageNet dataset is used in these ResNet50 v1.5 examples.
Download and preprocess the ImageNet dataset using the [instructions here](/datasets/imagenet/README.md).
After running the conversion script you should have a directory with the
ImageNet dataset in the TF records format.

Set the `DATASET_DIR` to point to this directory when running ResNet50 v1.5.

## Quick Start Scripts

| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [`training_demo.sh`](/quickstart/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/training/cpu/training_demo.sh) | Executes a short run using small batch sizes and a limited number of steps to demonstrate the training flow |
| [`training_1_epoch.sh`](/quickstart/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/training/cpu/training_1_epoch.sh) | Executes a test run that trains the model for 1 epoch and saves checkpoint files to an output directory. |
| [`training_full.sh`](/quickstart/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/training/cpu/training_full.sh) | Trains the model using the full dataset and runs until convergence (90 epochs) and saves checkpoint files to an output directory. Note that this will take a considerable amount of time. |
| [`multi_instance_training_demo.sh`](/quickstart/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/training/cpu/multi_instance_training_demo.sh) | Uses mpirun to execute 2 processes with 1 process per socket with a batch size of 1 for 50 steps. |
| [`multi_instance_training.sh`](/quickstart/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/training/cpu/multi_instance_training.sh) | Uses mpirun to execute 1 process per socket with a batch size of 1024 for the specified precision (fp32 or bfloat16 or bfloat32 or fp16). Checkpoint files and logs for each instance are saved to the output directory.|

Set the environment variables, navigate to your model zoo directory and run quickstart scripts. See the [list of quickstart scripts](#quick-start-scripts) for details on the different options.
```
# cd to your model zoo directory
cd models

export DATASET_DIR=<path to the ImageNet TF records>
export OUTPUT_DIR=<path to the directory where log files and checkpoints will be written>
export PRECISION=<set the precision to "fp32" or "bfloat16" or "bfloat32" or "fp16">
# For a custom batch size, set env var `BATCH_SIZE` or it will run with a default value.
export BATCH_SIZE=<customized batch size value>

./quickstart/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/training/cpu/<script name>.sh
```
